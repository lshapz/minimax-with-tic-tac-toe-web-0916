# Minimax Algorithm and Tic Tac Toe

## Objectives
Make an unbeatable tic-tac-toe game by implementing a [recursive](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/recursion/) [minimax](http://www.neverstopbuilding.com/minimax) method that will optimize the computer's moves.

## Instructions
* You'll be writing code in the `lib/tic_tac_toe.rb` file.
* This is a test-driven lab so just get those specs to pass. They're ordered by ascending difficulty so start with the first tests before moving down the line.
* If you get stuck on the `computer_move` specs, read the resources on recursion and the minimax algorithm. 
* Once all tests pass, run `rackup` from the command line before visiting `localhost:9292/`. The tic-tac-toe game should be fully functional. 
* Launch to Heroku if you feel called to and see the Heroku docs below for more details.
